# Balagaru Mutt — Static Website (Netlify-ready)

This repository contains a minimal, traditional static website for Balagaru Mutt, Teerthahalli.
It is intentionally simple and respectful in design, suitable for deploying on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Key features
------------
- Pure static HTML + CSS (no server-side code).
- Netlify CMS integration for managing News & Events and Media.
- News items stored as Markdown files in `content/news/`.
- A small client-side script reads `content/news/index.json` to list news (homepage and news page).
- Deployable immediately on Netlify (recommended) or GitHub Pages.

Netlify CMS setup (recommended)
------------------------------
1. Deploy this repository to Netlify:
   - Connect your GitHub repo in Netlify.
   - Set the build command to none (no build) — or leave empty, using "publish directory" = root.
   - Publish directory: `/` (this repo is pure static files)

2. Enable Identity and Git Gateway:
   - In Netlify site dashboard -> Identity -> Enable Identity.
   - After enabling Identity, go to Settings -> Identity -> Services -> Git Gateway -> Enable.
   - Under "Identity" > "Settings and usage" consider enabling "Invitations" and create admin users.

3. Configure the admin panel:
   - Visit https://<your-site>/.netlify/identity to manage users or invite.
   - Access the CMS at https://<your-site>/admin/
   - Login using Netlify Identity. Netlify CMS will commit changes to the main branch via Git Gateway.

Notes about news listing
------------------------
- The static site reads `/content/news/index.json` to obtain the list of news items, then fetches the individual markdown file when a visitor requests to view it.
- Netlify CMS will create markdown files in `content/news/`. To keep the site listing in sync you can:
  - Edit `content/news/index.json` manually via repository or add it via Netlify CMS's file editor (the config includes a "News Index" file entry).
  - Or maintain a simple process: after adding a news markdown, also update `content/news/index.json` with an entry:
    { "file": "YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md", "title": "...", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "excerpt": "..." }

Security and admin
------------------
- No passwords or secrets are stored in code.
- Authentication uses Netlify Identity + Git Gateway (git-gateway backend in admin/config.yml).
- Only enable and invite trusted admins.

Extending / Improvements
------------------------
- Add a tiny build script (GitHub Action) to generate `index.json` automatically when news are added.
- Improve gallery listing by creating a manifest of uploaded images; Netlify CMS media library provides uploads to `images/uploads`.
- Replace placeholder contact details with real phone/email.

Support & Troubleshooting
-------------------------
- If News do not show on the homepage or news page:
  - Ensure `content/news/index.json` exists and is valid JSON.
  - Ensure markdown files referenced by `index.json` exist in `content/news/`.

Thank you

This template emphasises clarity and tradition. If you want additional pages (services, donations, schedule), they can be added as simple HTML files following the same style.
