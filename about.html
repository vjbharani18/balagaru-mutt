          <p>Balagaru Akshobhya Tirtha Mutt (also known as Balagaru Akshobya Mutt) is a traditional monastic institution (mutt) located in <strong>Baalagaru village</strong>, Tirthahalli Taluk, Shimoga District, Karnataka. The mutt is situated on the banks of the sacred <strong>river Tunga</strong>, approximately 4 KM from Tirthahalli town and 46 KM from Shivamogga (Shimoga).</p>
          <p>It is dedicated to preserving the Vedic teachings, the Guru–Shishya parampara and serving the local community. Our Samsthanam follows the <strong>Madhwa Siddhanta</strong> (Dvaita Vedanta) tradition, established by Sri Madhvacharya in the 13th century.</p>
          <p><strong>This mutt is also the Moola Mutt (root mutt) of Kangu Mutt</strong> (Kangu means Adike). The mutt was first headed by <strong>Sri Lokavandita Teertharu</strong> (1374 CE), who was the 6th Acharya in the parampara lineage from Sri Madhvacharya.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The Mutt was established to serve as a centre for study and practice of dharma, with emphasis on scriptural learning, performance of ritual duties and community seva. Over the years the Mutt has supported students of Vedic learning and engaged in social welfare in nearby villages.</p>
          <p>The Samsthanam traces its lineage to the <strong>Madhwa tradition</strong>, which emphasizes the eternal distinction between the Supreme Lord (Vishnu), individual souls (Jivas), and matter (Jada). This philosophy, known as <em>Dvaita Vedanta</em> or <em>Tattvavada</em>, was systematically established by Sri Madhvacharya, who wrote extensive commentaries on the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras.</p>
          <p>The mutt has a rich history with approximately <strong>12 Vrundavanas</strong> (samadhi shrines) of Madhwa pontiffs, though some records were lost due to floods in earlier times. The mutt continues to preserve these sacred traditions and the unbroken Guru-Shishya parampara.</p>

          <h2>Sacred Deities</h2>
          <p>The mutt is blessed with several sacred deities and saligramas:</p>
          <ul class="deity-list">
            <li><strong>Sri Madhwacharyara kararchita Sri Rama Devaru:</strong> The heavenly idols (sculptures) of <strong>Vaikunta Rama, Vaikunta Seetha & Lakshmana</strong> were made by Vishwakarma and were given to Lava & Kusha, sons of Lord Rama. These divine idols are worshipped in the mutt.</li>
            <li><strong>Sri Akshobya Teertha kararchita Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Devaru:</strong> Worshipped with great devotion, this deity was established by Sri Akshobya Teertharu.</li>
            <li><strong>Narasimha Saligrama:</strong> While performing penance in Kudli seeking blessings of Lord Narasimha, Sri Akshobya Teertharu received two fruits from the Lord. One was offered to the king of Anegundi, and the other transformed into a sacred saligrama, which is worshipped in the mutt even today.</li>
            <li><strong>Sri Anantha Padmanabha Devaru:</strong> The Supreme Lord in His cosmic form, worshipped with reverence.</li>
            <li><strong>Vishwambhara Saligrama:</strong> A unique and rare saligrama with <strong>eleven openings (Vadana) and twenty-two chakras</strong> called Vishwambhara. While taking a holy dip in Swami Pushkarani in Thirumala hills, Sri Akshobya Teertharu received this sacred saligrama, on which Lord Srinivasa appeared as a symbol of his affection and grace. This is being worshipped in the mutt even today.</li>
            <li><strong>Lord Jayarama:</strong> The idol of Lord Jayarama was given by Jayatheertha to Trailokyabhushana Teertharu, which came to Kudli Math and is associated with this lineage.</li>
